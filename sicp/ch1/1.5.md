Q. Ben Bitdiddle has invented a test to determine whether the interpreter he is faced with is using applicative-order evaluation or normal-order evaluation. He defines the following two procedures:

``` scheme
(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
  (if (= x 0)
      0
      y))
```

Then he evaluates the expression

``` scheme
(test 0 (p))
```

What behavior will Ben observe with an interpreter that uses applicative-order evaluation? What behavior will he observe with an interpreter that uses normal-order evaluation? Explain your answer. \
\

Ans. For a system that uses applicative order evaluation, nothing will run because `(test 0 (p))` will evaluate `(p)` which will lead to an infinite loop. For normative-order, we will see 0 because `(p)` isn't evaluated and isn't the result of the conditional expression so will never be evaluated.
