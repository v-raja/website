Q. Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:
```scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
```

Ans. The if-expression evaluates to '+' or '-' which are symbols for a lambda functions that take two arguments and adds/subtracts them.
