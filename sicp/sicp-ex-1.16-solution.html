<b>Exercise 1.16</b>
<p>Q. Design a procedure that evolves an iterative exponentiation process that uses successive squaring and uses a logarithmic number of steps, as does <code>fast-expt</code>. (Hint: Using the observation that <span class="math inline">\((b^{\frac{n}{2}})^2 = (b^2)^\frac{n}{2}\)</span>, keep, along with the exponent <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and the base <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, an additional state variable <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, and define the state transformation in such a way that the product <span class="math inline">\(a b^n\)</span> is unchanged from state to state. At the beginning of the process <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is taken to be 1, and the answer is given by the value of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> at the end of the process. In general, the technique of defining an <em>invariant quantity</em> that remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful way to think about the design of iterative algorithms.)</p>
