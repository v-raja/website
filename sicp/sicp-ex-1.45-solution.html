<b>Exercise 1.45</b>
<p>Q. We saw in section 1.3.3 that attempting to compute square roots by naively finding a fixed point of <span class="math inline">\(y \rightarrow x/y\)</span> does not converge, and that this can be fixed by average damping. The same method works for finding cube roots as fixed points of the average-damped <span class="math inline">\(y \rightarrow x/y^2\)</span>. Unfortunately, the process does not work for fourth roots â€“ a single average damp is not enough to make a fixed-point search for <span class="math inline">\(y \rightarrow x/y^3\)</span> converge. On the other hand, if we average damp twice (i.e., use the average damp of the average damp of <span class="math inline">\(y \rightarrow x/y^3\)</span>) the fixed-point search does converge. Do some experiments to determine how many average damps are required to compute <span class="math inline">\(n^{th}\)</span> roots as a fixed-point search based upon repeated average damping of <span class="math inline">\(y \rightarrow x/y^{n-1}\)</span>. Use this to implement a simple procedure for computing nth roots using <code>fixed-point</code>, <code>average-damp</code>, and the <code>repeated</code> procedure of exercise 1.43. Assume that any arithmetic operations you need are available as primitives.</p>
