I enjoy browsing through peoples' bookshelves ([Patrick Collison's](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf) and [Andrej Karapthy's](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/13472185-andrej-karpathy?shelf=read) are particularly insightful) to get recommendations of what to read.

* The Power of Now

Autobiographies:
