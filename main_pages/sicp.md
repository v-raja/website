# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

"...the book tells you what [object-oriented programming] principles are, how they came to be selected as worthwhile, how they can be how a different combination of principles might be more appropriate for some quires you to understand the range of possibilities, and to think about rough the design process. Programming is a craft that is subject to frequent failure: many projects are started and abandoned because the designers do not have the flexibility, experience and understanding to come up with a suitable design and implementation. SICP gives you an approach that will succeed, but it is an approach based on principles and wisdom, not on a checklist." - [Peter Norving](https://norvig.com/) on [SICP](https://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm)
